/**
 * One-shot cleanup for browsers carrying pre-PR-3.2 state.
 *
 * Without this, returning users are stuck in a loop: the old service worker
 * serves the cached old app shell, which tries to hit `moda-api.*`/permissions
 * (an endpoint removed in PR 3.2) with MSAL-direct-to-API tokens, gets 401,
 * retries forever. Clearing site data manually works; users shouldn't have to.
 *
 * On first load per browser after this ships:
 *   1. Unregister every service worker (nukes the stale cached app shell).
 *   2. Delete every Cache Storage entry (nukes stale chunks + runtime-cached
 *      API responses the old SW populated).
 *   3. Migrate any renamed localStorage keys (copy value to new key), then
 *      drop the old entries — preserves user preferences across renames.
 *   4. Remove pre-rename storage entries that we're not preserving (auth
 *      tokens, etc. — they need to be reacquired anyway).
 *   5. Mark the cleanup done (localStorage flag) and hard-reload so the fresh
 *      app boots without the old SW intercepting.
 *
 * Gated by a per-release marker so it runs at most once per browser per
 * release. Subsequent releases bump `RELEASE_MARKER_VALUE` to force another
 * pass; the marker key itself stays stable so we don't leak flags.
