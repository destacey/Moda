# Project Portfolio Status

The Project Portfolio Status document outlines the various statuses a [project portfolio](project-portfolio.md) can have, along with their definitions, key requirements, and usage scenarios. It also includes a lifecycle description for each status and transition rules to guide how portfolios can move between different statuses.

## Summary Table

| **Status** | **Definition** | **Key Requirements** | **Usage** |
|----|----|---|---|
| **Proposed** | Initial stage, not yet active or approved. | No dates required. | Planning and evaluation. |
| **Active** | Portfolio is approved and operational. | Start date required. | Execution phase of the portfolio lifecycle. |
| **On Hold** | Temporarily paused; no active progress. | Start date required. | External or internal constraints. |
| **Completed** | All work is done; portfolio goals achieved. Associated projects/programs must be completed or cancelled. | Start and end dates required. | Finished lifecycle, kept for reporting. |
| **Archived** | Retired or obsolete portfolio; no further changes expected. | Start and end dates required. | Historical purposes only. |

## Lifecycle

### Proposed

The portfolio is in the early planning or conceptualization stage. It has not yet been approved or activated for execution.

Key Points:

- Used when the portfolio is being evaluated for feasibility or alignment with strategic goals.
- Typically does not have projects/programs fully assigned or operational yet.
- No start date or end date is required at this stage.

Example Scenarios:

- A new product development portfolio is being pitched to stakeholders.
- Strategic initiatives are being gathered and grouped under a potential portfolio.

### Active

The portfolio has been approved and is actively managed, with projects/programs in progress.

Key Points:

- The start date must be set when transitioning to this status.
- Represents the primary operational phase of the portfolio.
- New projects or programs may be added, removed, or updated.

Example Scenarios:

- A portfolio tracking technology upgrades across business units is in full swing.
- The organization is actively executing initiatives to meet specific strategic goals.

### On Hold

The portfolio is temporarily paused, and active work on associated projects/programs is halted.

Key Points:

- Used when external or internal factors cause a temporary suspension of work.
- The start date remains unchanged, but the portfolio is flagged as inactive until resumed.
- No new projects/programs are typically added during this time.

Example Scenarios:

- Budgetary constraints require a temporary halt to portfolio activities.
- Leadership decides to deprioritize the portfolio due to shifting organizational focus.

### Completed

The portfolio has achieved its intended goals, and all associated projects/programs are finished.

Key Points:

- The end date must be set when transitioning to this status.
- No further changes or additions are expected for the portfolio.
- The portfolio is retained for historical and reporting purposes.

Example Scenarios:

- A marketing campaign portfolio successfully launched all planned initiatives.
- A portfolio managing a strategic digital transformation reached its target state.

### Archived

The portfolio is no longer active, regardless of whether all its projects/programs are completed. It has been closed and moved into a historical state.

Key Points:

- Used when a portfolio is retired due to organizational changes or obsolescence.
- The end date must be set when transitioning to this status.
- Projects/programs within the portfolio may be reassigned or independently archived.

Example Scenarios:

- A portfolio managing legacy systems is archived after migrating to a new platform.
- A product portfolio is retired after the associated product line is discontinued.
