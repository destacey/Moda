## Program Increment
A program increment (PI) refers to a timeframe for project development in which a group of teams and teams of teams delivers a certain value. It is typically a set period of 8-12 weeks during which teams work to deliver team objectives identified in PI Planning.

### Teams
Each PI will have many teams and teams of teams associated to it.  This relationship provides the basis for which work, sprints, objectives, and risks can be aggregated and managed.

### Objectives
A team objective represents a commitment from a team to deliver a specific outcome within the target PI.  Team objectives can be aggregated into team of teams objectives to help provide a summary for senior leadership.

### Iteration
An iteration is used to define the sprint schedule for all teams during the PI.  It is also used to group the team sprints for that period to provide an aggregate view.

**Example**
A three month PI will have about six two week long sprints.  If the PI had five teams associated to it, then all five teams would have their first sprint associated to the first iteration, the second sprints associated to the second iteration, and so on.

## Sprint
A sprint is a short period in which a team implements and delivers a discrete and potentially shippable application increment. Essentially, a sprint is a set amount of time that a team has to complete a specific amount of work. Sprints are generally planned to last about two weeks, though they can be as short as one week or as long as a month.

## Risk
A risk is the potential that a circumstance could arise that alters the outcome of a project, objective or work, for better or for worse. Risks affect deliverables, timelines, and budgets. They can lead to a projectâ€™s failure if not managed properly.
